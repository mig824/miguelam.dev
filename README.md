## Hello There

I always thought having your own site was pretty cool and I felt like building something for myself, so here it is.\
For now it's just meant to be a quick intro of myself, but I certainly plan on adding more stuff here & there.

**I'm also building a blog**\
It's mainly for my personal use, a place where I can write stuff to help my future self\
It'll contain stuff I learned, setbacks I've encountered, things I've noticed, etc...\
If it happens to help someone else then that's awesome too\
That's why I'm putting it out there!

It lives in the `blog` branch of this repo\
The site is live at [blog.mmiguel.dev](https://blog.mmiguel.dev)
