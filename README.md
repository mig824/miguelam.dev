## Hola 👋🏽

I've been thinking about building my own blog for some time now,\
so I decided to finally do it.

I go more in-depth on my motivations behind it in my [first post](https://blog.mmiguel.dev/hello-world)\
so if you're curious about that go take a look! 😄

This blog is a partner to my main site, [mmiguel.dev](https://mmiguel.dev),\
which lives in the `main` branch of this repo.
