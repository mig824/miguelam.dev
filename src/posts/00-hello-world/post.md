## Motivations

I've been thinking about building my own blog for some time now,\
so I decided to finally do it.

I think the biggest thing holding me back was not knowing what to write about,\
but after some thought I realized that wasn't the case.

The problem was that I was trying to guess what other people wanted to read about\
and trying to write something based on that.

So after some thought I decided to simply jot down some things that I find helpful\
so that I can reference them later to help me out.

If someone else happens to stumble through this blog and finds some value\
then that would be _AWESOME_ too.

That's why I decided to put this out there on the interwebs\
instead of just throwing it in my own private [Dropbox](https://dropbox.com)\
_Quick little plug since I enjoy using it and I just started working there_ 🥳

Another reason behind this is that I've never been much of writer\
and that's something I've been wanting to change.

I figured, _What better way to improve my writing than to write?_

Revolutionary, I know...

The way I see it, only positives can come from this.

- Build a skill I've been wanting build
- Learn & develop a deeper understanding of various topics
- Save my future self from tearing my hair out because of some pesky bug, edge case, etc...
- Possibly provide something useful to someone else out there

Oh, and ANOTHER reason is that I've been itchin' to build something\
and since I'm in-between jobs, making this blog -- along with my [main site](https://mmiguel.dev) -- was a great excuse 😉

## What the heck will even be in this blog?

Well, person reading this, let me tell ya...

It'll consist of several different things, but it'll mainly be programming related.

You're mostly going to find concepts I just learned and want to write about to solidify my own understanding,\
explanations of setbacks I've encountered and how I moved passed them,\
posts that I wish existed when I really needed them but couldn't find -- _sad face_ --\
and a braindump of thoughts I have about programming, learning, work, life, anything really...

This blog is meant to kinda just be there throughout my career that I'm just starting out.\
There will be some months where I write a lot and there will be some where I don't write at all.

## How did you build this thing?

Another great question, imaginary person\
I think that's a good subject for another post.

I'll stick a link to it here when I get around to writing it\
_See I think I'm getting the hang of this_

Anywho...thanks for stopping by! 🙋🏽‍♂️👋🏽
